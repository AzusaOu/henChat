## Deployment

### Python-Server

hcServer.py is the server. It works with websocket_server/.

### Node.js-Server

Install Node.js and npm first, then

```
cd nodejs_server
npm install
cd src
node app.js
```

### Client

Index.html works as interface, which also needs rsa.js (crypto support), hc-core.js and listener.js in folder "js".<br>
And a HTTP server is necessary. Even though end-to-end encryption is supported since 2018.04.05, you'd better deploy it with TLS protection.
